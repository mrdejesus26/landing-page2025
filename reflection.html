  <h1>Reflection on Using AI for Coding</h1>
  <p><strong>AI Tool(s) Used:</strong> ChatGPT</p>
  <p><strong>How It Helped:</strong> ChatGPT helped generate the initial HTML and CSS structure for my landing page. It also provided suggestions for the layout and styling adjustments. The AI's ability to generate code quickly saved time and helped me focus on the creative aspects of the design.</p>
  <p><strong>Challenges Encountered:</strong> Sometimes the suggestions from the AI were not perfect, and I had to make adjustments. Understanding the code structure was crucial to make these changes. Also, making sure the page was mobile responsive and adjusting the form styles was a bit tricky.</p>
  <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> AI tools like ChatGPT can be valuable for speeding up the coding process, but they still require human input for refinement and optimization. It was a great way to automate some parts of coding while allowing me to focus on the user experience and overall design.</p>
