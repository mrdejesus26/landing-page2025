  <h1>AI Tool Reflection</h1>

  <p><strong>Which AI tool(s) did you use?</strong></p>
  <p>I used ChatGPT to assist in writing HTML and CSS code for my personal branding landing page.</p>

  <p><strong>How did it help you?</strong></p>
  <p>ChatGPT helped by generating HTML structure and CSS styling, which saved time and ensured clean, responsive code. It also offered guidance for layout changes, animations, and responsiveness based on my feedback.</p>

  <p><strong>What challenges did you encounter?</strong></p>
  <p>At times, changes to the GitHub-hosted HTML were not reflected immediately. Refreshing cache and making sure all linked files were correctly referenced helped resolve this. Designing a contact form layout and aligning services into three columns also required fine-tuning.</p>

  <p><strong>What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?</strong></p>
  <p>I learned that AI tools like ChatGPT can accelerate the development process, offer creative solutions, and act as real-time collaborators. However, understanding basic HTML/CSS structure is still crucial for implementing changes, debugging, and customizing layouts.</p>
